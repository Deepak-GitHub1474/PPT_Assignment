# Difference between Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

# Virtual DOM:

- Lightweight: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained by React.

- In-memory representation: It resides in memory and is not directly connected to the browser's 
  rendering engine.

- Efficient updates: React performs updates and modifications on the virtual DOM first, allowing
  it to optimize and batch changes before updating the actual DOM.

- Diffing algorithm: React's reconciliation process compares the previous virtual DOM with the new 
  virtual DOM to determine the minimal changes needed to update the real DOM efficiently.

- Abstracted from browser specifics: The Virtual DOM is not browser-specific and provides a consistent 
  interface for React components across different environments.

# Real DOM:

- Actual browser representation: The Real DOM is the browser's internal representation of the HTML 
  structure.
- Heavyweight: The Real DOM is a more complex and memory-intensive structure compared to the virtual DOM.

- Direct interaction: Manipulating the Real DOM directly triggers browser reflows and repaints, which 
  can be costly in terms of performance.
- Slower updates: Updating the Real DOM directly for every change can be slower, especially when dealing 
  with large or complex UIs.
- Browser-specific: The Real DOM is specific to the browser environment and may have subtle differences 
  and performance characteristics across different browsers.
- In summary, the Virtual DOM acts as an intermediary layer between the developer's code and the actual 
  DOM, providing an efficient way to update and render UI components in React.
