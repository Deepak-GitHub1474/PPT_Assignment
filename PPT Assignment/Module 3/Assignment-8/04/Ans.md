# What's a component? Types of components

In React, a component is a self-contained, reusable piece of UI that can be composed 
to build larger UI structures. 

# Components in React can be categorized into two main types:

- Functional Components: Also known as stateless components, functional components are 
  defined as JavaScript functions. They receive props (input data) as arguments and return 
  JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI structure. Functional components are simple and 
  straightforward, focusing on rendering UI based on the given props.

- Class Components: Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.
  Component class. They have a more feature-rich API and can maintain an internal state in 
  addition to receiving props. Class components have lifecycle methods that allow you to 
  control the component's behavior at different stages of its lifecycle.
