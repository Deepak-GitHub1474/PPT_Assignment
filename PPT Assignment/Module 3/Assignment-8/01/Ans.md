#  What's React and its pros and cons?

# React:
- React is open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render those components 
  when the underlying data changes.
- It is maintained by Meta or Facebook.

# Props:
- props stands for properties.
- Props are arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
- React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
- React Props are read-only! You will get an error if you try to change their value.
- Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.
- React props also helps when we want to use a long string to manipulate, So we can store the string 
  into a variable and than using props we can get that string by {props.variableName}

- Component-based architecture: React encourages building UIs as a composition of reusable components, 
  making it easier to maintain and update code.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which allows for efficient updates and 
  rendering of components.
- Declarative syntax: React uses a declarative approach, where developers describe how the UI should look 
  based on the current state, rather than manipulating the DOM directly.
- Efficient rendering: React efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components when the data 
  changes, thanks to its virtual DOM and diffing algorithm.
- Large community and ecosystem: React has a vast community of developers, a rich ecosystem of libraries and 
  tools, and extensive documentation and support.

# Cons:
- Complex tooling setup: React projects often require additional tooling, such as build systems (e.g., Webpack) 
  and package managers (e.g., npm or Yarn), which can be overwhelming for beginners.
- Boilerplate code: React's syntax and structure may require writing more code compared to simpler frameworks 
  or libraries.
- Frequent updates: React evolves rapidly, which means staying up to date with the latest changes and best 
  practices can be challenging.
