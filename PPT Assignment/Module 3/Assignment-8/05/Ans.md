# Difference between class-based and function-based components.

# Class-based components:

- Syntax: Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React component class.

- State management: Class components can have an internal state managed by this.state and updated 
  using this.setState(). They also have lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount and 
  componentDidUpdate, for handling side effects and managing component lifecycle.

- Complexity: Class components tend to be more verbose and require additional code for defining the 
  component, handling state, and managing lifecycle methods.

- Legacy approach: Class components were the primary way of creating components in older versions 
  of React before the introduction of hooks.

# Function-based components:

- Syntax: Function components are defined as JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and 
  return JSX to describe the UI.
- Simplicity: Function components are simpler and have a more concise syntax compared to class components. 
  They focus on rendering UI based on props and don't have built-in state or lifecycle methods.

- Hooks: With the introduction of React Hooks, function components can now manage state, perform side 
  effects, and have lifecycle-like behavior using hooks like useState, useEffect, and more.

- Recommended approach: Function components are the recommended approach for creating components in 
  modern React applications, as they provide a more straightforward and functional programming style.
