# Q1 What are hooks in React? How to identify hooks?

- Answer: In React, hooks are functions that allow us to `use state` and other React features 
  in functional components without writing a class. Hooks provide a way to reuse stateful 
  logic across components.

  Hooks can be identified by the naming convention that starts with the word "use" 
  (e.g., useState, useEffect). This convention helps developers easily recognize and 
  differentiate hooks from regular functions.

# Q2. Explain useState Hook & what can you achieve with it?

- Answer: The useState hook is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components 
  to manage state. It enables to add stateful behavior to functional components without 
  converting them into class components.

  With the useState hook, we can declare a state variable and a function to update it. It 
  takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current 
  state value and a function to update the state. By calling the update function, we can 
  update the state value and trigger a re-render of the component.

  The useState hook enables to achieve the following with functional components:

- Define and manage component-level state.
- Access and modify state within the component's lifecycle.
- Trigger re-renders based on state changes.
- Implement interactive behavior and user interactions.

# Q.3 How to pass data from one component to another component?

- Answer: In React, you can pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. 
  Here's how you can do it:

  In the parent component, define the data you want to pass as a prop.
  Include the child component and pass the data as a prop by setting an attribute with a value.
  In the child component, access the passed data by using the prop name.

  Example:
  /*

     // Parent component

    `function ParentComponent() {`
    `const data = "Hello, Child!";`
    `return <ChildComponent message={data} />`;
    `}`

    // Child component

    `function ChildComponent(props) {`
      `return <h2>{props.message}</h2>;`
 `   }`

    */

  In this example, the ParentComponent passes the data as a prop called message to the ChildComponent. 
  The ChildComponent then accesses and displays the value of the prop.

# Q.4 What is the significance of the "key" prop in React lists, and why is it important to use it correctly?

- Answer: In React, the key prop is a special attribute used when rendering lists of components. The key prop 
  helps React identify each component in the list uniquely and efficiently update and reorder the components 
  when the list changes.

# The significance of the key prop is as follows:

  Efficient Updates: When React renders a list of components, it needs a way to determine which components are 
  added, removed, or changed. The key prop allows React to perform efficient updates by matching old keys with 
  new keys and updating only the necessary components.
  Preventing Reordering Issues: Without a key prop, React may have difficulty differentiating between components 
  and may mistakenly reorder them when the list changes. The key prop helps maintain the correct order of 
  components in the list.

# Importantance:

- Uniqueness: Each key value within a list should be unique among siblings. It helps React accurately identify 
  and update components.

- Stability: The key prop should be stable across component renders. Avoid using indexes as keys, as they may 
  lead to issues when reordering or filtering the list.

- Immutable Keys: Once assigned, the key prop should remain constant. Changing the key can cause unexpected 
  behavior and hinder component reusability.

# Q.5 What is the significance of using "setState" instead of modifying state directly in React?

- Answer: In React, modifying state directly is not recommended. Instead, use the setState function provided by 
  React to update the state. By using setState in React, it adheres to React's guidelines, ensure proper state 
  management, and maintain a predictable and efficient rendering process.

# Here's the significance of using setState:

- State Management: The setState function ensures that React is aware of state changes and triggers the necessary 
  re-renders. When you modify state directly, React may not detect the change, resulting in UI inconsistencies.

- Batched Updates: React batches multiple setState calls together, optimizing the rendering process. If we modify
  state directly, React may not batch the updates, leading to unnecessary re-renders and reduced performance.

- Immutability and State Consistency: React components should follow the principle of immutability, where state is 
  treated as read-only and not modified directly. setState enforces this principle and helps maintain state 
  consistency across the component tree.

- Lifecycle Methods and Side Effects: setState ensures that state updates are synchronized with React's component 
  lifecycle and side-effect handling mechanisms. Directly modifying state may bypass these mechanisms and cause 
  unpredictable behavior.

# Q.6 Explain the concept of React fragments and when you should use them.

- Answer: React fragments provide a way to group multiple elements without introducing unnecessary parent elements 
  to the HTML structure. Fragments are especially useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component's 
  render method.
       Conceptually, a fragment is a lightweight wrapper that allows you to group elements without creating an 
       additional DOM node. It doesn't generate any extra HTML markup and has no impact on styling or layout.
  
  It is mandatory to have a parent wrapper to use multiple child elements, So instead of using <div></div> container
  we can use `<> </>` as a wrapper.

  Example:

    function ComponentWithFragments() {
    return (
        <>
        `<h1>Heading 1</h1>`
        `<p>Paragraph 1</p>`
        `<p>Paragraph 2</p>`
        </>
    )
    }

  In the above example, the <> and </> (empty angle brackets) act as a fragment wrapper, allowing you to group multiple elements (<h1> and two <p> elements) without introducing an extra parent element.

# React fragments use:

- You need to return multiple elements from a component's render method without adding unnecessary parent elements.
- You want to avoid additional levels in the HTML structure, which might affect CSS styles or layout.
- You have a list of elements where each item requires a wrapper element, and you want to avoid adding extra nodes to 
  the DOM.

# Q.7 How do you handle conditional rendering in React?

- Answer: Conditional rendering in React allows you to show or hide components or elements based on certain conditions. 
  Here are several approaches to handle conditional rendering in React:

-  If statements:

    `function MyComponent() {`
    `if (condition) {`
        `return <h1>Show when condition is true</h1>;`
    `} else {`
        `return <h1>Show when condition is false</h1>;`
    `}`
    `}`

-  Ternary Operator:

    `function MyComponent() {`
    `return condition ? <h1>Show when condition is true</h1> : <h1>Show when condition is false</h1>;`
    `}`

-  Logical && operator:

    `function MyComponent() {`
    `return condition && <h1>Show when condition is true</h1>;`
    `}`

-  Element variables:

    `function MyComponent() {`
    `let element;`
    `if (condition) {`
        `element = <h1>Show when condition is true</h1>;`
    `} else {`
        `element = <h1>Show when condition is false</h1>;`
    `}`
    `return element;`
    `}`
