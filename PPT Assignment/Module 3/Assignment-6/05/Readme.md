# Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on 
providing a simplified and high-level representation of complex systems or objects. 
It involves capturing the essential features and behavior of an object or system while 
hiding unnecessary implementation details.

- Simplified Representation: Abstraction allows to represent complex systems or objects 
  in a simplified manner. It focuses on highlighting the most relevant and essential aspects 
  while omitting unnecessary details.

- Hiding Implementation Details: Abstraction involves hiding the internal implementation 
  details of an object or system from the outside world. The internal workings and complexities 
  of the object are encapsulated, making them invisible to the external entities interacting 
  with the object. This information hiding enhances security, reduces dependencies, and allows 
  for changes in the implementation without affecting the code that uses the object.

- Creating Abstract Classes or Interfaces: It serve as blueprints or contracts that define a 
  common interface or set of methods to be implemented by the derived classes or objects.

- Managing Complexity: Abstraction helps manage the complexity of large-scale software systems.
  By providing a simplified and concise representation, it allows developers to focus on the 
  essential aspects of the system. This simplification aids in comprehension, maintenance,
  and collaboration among team members working on different components of the system.

# Purpose:
The purpose of abstraction is to enable effective design, development, and maintenance of complex 
software systems. It helps in reducing cognitive load, managing complexity, and providing a clear 
and concise interface for interacting with objects or systems. Abstraction enhances code reusability, 
flexibility, and maintainability, ultimately leading to more efficient and scalable software development.
