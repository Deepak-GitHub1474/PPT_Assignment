# Explain OOPS ?

OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the 
use of objects to structure and organize code. which are instances of classes or prototypes. 
OOPS focuses on creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code. By following OOP principles, 
software developers can design modular, reusable, and maintainable code. OOP promotes the 
organization of code into logical units (objects and classes), reduces code duplication, enhances 
code flexibility, and makes it easier to understand and modify code over time.

The core principles of OOP are:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
