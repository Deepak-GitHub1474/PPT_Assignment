# Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different 
types to be treated as instances of a common superclass or interface. It enables a single 
interface to be used to represent and interact with different types of objects.

# Purpose:

The purpose of polymorphism is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for designing 
and implementing software systems. It allows code to be written in a more generic and reusable 
manner, simplifying maintenance and promoting code scalability. Polymorphism enhances code 
organization, facilitates code integration, and supports the principle of coding to interfaces 
rather than specific implementations.
