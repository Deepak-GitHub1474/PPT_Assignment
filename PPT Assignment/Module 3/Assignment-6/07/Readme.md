# Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOPs that allows objects or classes to inherit 
properties and methods from other objects or classes. It establishes a hierarchical 
relationship between classes, where a derived class inherits characteristics from a base 
class.

# Purpose:

 The purpose of inheritance is to facilitate code reuse, promote modularity, and establish 
 relationships between classes based on their shared characteristics. By inheriting properties 
 and methods from a superclass, subclasses can build upon existing functionality, customize 
 behavior, and create specialized implementations. Inheritance is a core principle of OOP that 
 supports the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, leading to more 
 efficient, maintainable, and extensible code.
