# Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept OOPs that combines data and methods into a single 
unit called an object. It involves bundling related data and functions together, while 
controlling access to the internal data through methods.

# Purpose:
The purpose of encapsulation is to achieve data hiding, data protection, and code organization, 
leading to better code maintainability and reusability.
Encapsulation enhances code maintainability, security, and reusability. By combining related 
data and methods into objects and controlling access through defined interfaces, encapsulation 
provides a robust mechanism for organizing and managing complex systems while protecting the 
integrity and privacy of data.
