# What are REST API ?

# REST(Representational State Transfer):
     How the data will be transformed, In which formate data will be transformed what are the 
     rules and standard to followed, security, caching etc. It is developed by Dr. Roy Fielding.

# REST based on core principle:
   - Client Server Architecture
   - Stateless Communication (As without login we can search and get the result or response)
   - Resource-Based Interaction
   - Uniform Interface
   - Cacheable
   - CRUD Operations: REST APIs typically map to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
     that can be performed on resources. These operations are performed using standard HTTP methods: 
     POST (create), GET (read), PUT/PATCH (update), and DELETE (delete). 

# API(Application Programming Interface):
   - An API is set of `protocol`, `tools` and `standards` that enables the communication between 
     different software application. Inother words, An API is a set of rules that developers can use 
     to build software that communicates with another system or application.
   - APIs allow developers to access certain features or data from an application without needing 
     to understand the underlying code or infrastructure of that application.
