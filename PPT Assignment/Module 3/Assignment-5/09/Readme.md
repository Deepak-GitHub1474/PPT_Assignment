# Whats fetch in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, the fetch() function is a built-in method that allows to make network 
requests and fetch resources from a specified URL. It provides a modern and flexible 
way to perform HTTP requests, such as retrieving data from APIs or loading external 
resources.

The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing 
the response to the request. This response object contains many information like the status 
code, headers, and the actual response data.
