# Explain Web Apis.

Web APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols provided by web 
browsers that allow developers to interact with various web-related functionalities and services. 
Web APIs provide a way to access and manipulate web content, perform network requests, handle events, 
access device features, and more. They enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web 
applications.

# Some commonly used web API:

- DOM API (Document Object Model API): The DOM API allows developers to access, manipulate, and modify
  the structure, content, and style of web documents (HTML and XML).It provides methods and properties
  to traverse and manipulate elements, handle events, modify styles and attributes, and dynamically
  update the web page content.
  
- XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API: These APIs enable making HTTP requests from web browsers.XMLHttpRequest
  is an API that provides the ability to send asynchronous HTTP requests and handle server responses.
  The newer Fetch API provides a more modern and flexible way to make network requests using promises.

- Canvas and WebGL API: These APIs enable rendering graphics and creating interactive visualizations within 
  a web browser. The Canvas API provides a 2D drawing context for dynamically generating and manipulating 
  graphics on a web page.

- Web Audio API: The Web Audio API allows developers to create, manipulate, and play audio within web 
  applications. It provides advanced audio processing capabilities, including generating sound, applying 
  effects, and managing audio sources and playback.These are just a few examples of the many Web APIs available.
  Each API provides specific functionalities and services, empowering developers to create rich and interactive 
  web applications. Web APIs are often used in conjunction with other technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML, 
  and CSS, to build dynamic and feature-rich web experiences.
