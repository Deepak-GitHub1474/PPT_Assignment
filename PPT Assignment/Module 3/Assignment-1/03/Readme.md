# Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

   - HTML Tags: Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML. They are used to define the structure and semantics of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), and they usually come in pairs an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an HTML element, while the closing tag indicates the end of that element.

    Example:	
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    In the above example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag.

    - HTML Elements: The opening and closing tags, along with the content, together form the element. For instance, in the previous example, the entire <p> tag, including the content "This is a paragraph.", represents the <p> element. HTML elements consist of tags, content, and optional attributes.
    
    Example:	
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>


    In the above example, when we added content between <p> tag and </p> this is now complete `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` is element.
