# Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

    Semantic tags are HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content on a web page. They help to give a better understanding of the content to both humans and machines, such as search engines. It also made easy to maintain the code for developer.

    Examples of semantic tags in HTML5 include:
    <header>: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
    <nav>: Represents a section of a page that contains navigation links.
    <article>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post or a news story.
    <section>: Represents a standalone section of a document, such as a chapter, a tabbed content area, or a set of related content.
    <aside>: Represents a section of a page that contains content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as a side bar or a pull quote.
    <footer>: Represents a container for the footer content of a document or section.

    We need it because using semantic tags, web developers can create more accessible, meaningful, and well-structured web pages that are easier for both humans and machines to understand.
