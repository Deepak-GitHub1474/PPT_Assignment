# Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

  - Tag: A tag is an HTML element name enclosed within angle brackets (< and >). It defines the structure and type of an element in the HTML document. Tags are used to create and define the different parts of a webpage. For example, the <p> tag represents a paragraph, the <h1> tag represents a heading, and the <div> tag represents a division or section.

    Example:
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <div>This is a division.</div>
    
    - Attribute: An attribute is used within the opening tag of an HTML element to provide additional information about that element. Attributes provide instructions that modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element. Attributes consist of a href, src, a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=) and enclosed in double quotes (").

    Example:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@developerstring">Click here</a>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
